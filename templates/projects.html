        <h1>CS GO PRO STATS</h1>

        <p>

            This project aims to create a reliable source of information for professional CS:GO player stats given that, at least at the time of the project conception, there was no good API related to eSport pro player stats. For CS:GO the only reliable way to get data is through HLTV, which does not have an official API, so the only way to get this project to work was to data-mine HLTV (I'm not sure how legal this is by the way) and store all of the information in a separate MongoDB database.
            
            <br><br>

            To use the code in the project you have to set up your own MongoDB database and you have to update the database through data mining (which is pretty slow because of a limit in the number of requests).

        <h1>IMAGE TO PAINTING</h1>
        <p>
            It's literally what it's called. This python program takes an image as an argument and spits out the same image just modified to look like a painting.
            <br>
            It's a bit slow due to its underlying algorithm. It takes the colour for every other N number of pixels and generates a random bezier curve starting in the same position and of the same colour. The thickness and remaining point coordinates are also randomly generated.

            <br>
            <br>

            If you want to use this project I recommend you play around with some of the variables to make sure you get the results you are looking for.

        <h1>BRAINFUCK INTERPRETER</h1>

        <p>
            Brainfuck is an esoteric language composed of eight basic commands, it essentially behaves like a Turing machine. It's pretty basic but it was a fairly fun and quick project. 


            <br>
            <br>

            To run the project you simply pass in a file path containing the code you intend to run and the interpreter will run the code. The program works on runtime.
