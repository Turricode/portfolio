        <h2>PROGRAMMING JOURNEY</h2>

        <p>
            I have been programming for fun for a few years now. I have learned a lot since then and I still feel like
            there is a lot to learn. Since the beggining I have became somewhat good at:

        <ul>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I have also developed interest in specific fieds in computer science. Though there are a lot of interesting areas
            I have personally have the most fun when doing:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Game Development</li>
            <li>Algorithm Visualization</li>

        <h2>FUTURE PLANS</h2>

        <p>
            I hope to continue learning more about CS, though I might know a few programming languages, my goal is to
            become much more competent in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rust</li>
