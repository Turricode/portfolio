!OpenGL

OpenGL can be a pain in the ass due to its state machine architecture but it 
integrates very well with [pure_c] and after an initial setup and abstaction
its not that bad. It does invlve some pretty intense math but in order
to avoid having to write a math lib from scrath I just use [cglm]
